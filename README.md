Workroom Volunteer Organizer: an app to create, assign and check out tasks at the Workroom at Schools.
How we solve: depending on the login information, the application will identify the user role (teacher, volunteer coordinator, volunteer) and will let to create, edit or remove tasks that need to be done in the workroom area at schools.

New library: nodemailer to email the user when a task has been assigned.
